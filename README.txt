                                                      README

The assignment5 folder contains the following folders:

-Evaluation
-MonteCarlo
-TimeEvaluationAgent (extra credit)
-TimeMonteCarlo (extra credit)

Evaluation folder contains implementation of alphabeta agent with evaluation functions. 
Monte Carlo folder contains implementation of Monte Carlo algorithm.
TimeEvaluationAgent folder contains implementation of evaluation functions with time constraint.
TimeMonteCarlo folder contains implementation of Monte Carlo with time constraint.

Monte Carlo is faster than other agents but it depends upon the iterations you select and the depth of other agents.
 
All 4 folders contain 4 different projects.

Note: Programming language used is Java and NetBeans IDE was used for this assignment.
      This program was tested on tux.

Instructions:
-Compile and run the Test.java file as it contains the main method.
-Source files are located in the following location:
  -assignment5 => AI => src => ai
-I have also included NetBeans build files, just in case.



For depth please enter values 1-7 because anything > 7 takes a long time.
For iterations please enter values greater than 1000 but less than 20000 because it takes a long time.
For time please enter value greater than 1000.
